## Overview

A crowd sourced application that allows users to report the availability of parking locations. These reports are compiled into a feed which will be shown on an interactive display that implements [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/). This data will be stored using [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup).
